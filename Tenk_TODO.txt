- auto claim dice (maybe move them up claimed or change box-shadow color)
    sol:
        - count number of rerolls and compare with last roll, if they're the same, deny the new
        - check which numbers won and use them to disable the dice
- rules box
- style creation screen
- "roll" animation (rando numbers like in cpp class)
- play again

- for same players, save to local storage, reload site, retrieve and then delete from local storage
